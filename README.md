# Blackjack (Python)
This was created as an exam project for the Python2 course at KEA.

## Some brief thoughts
I chose not to make the dealer playable even though it was a requirement. This was due to the nature of Blackjack.
The dealer always has to hit unless he/she has a handsum which is equal to or above 17.
I doubt this would be fun for anyone. I suppose I could have made it a tutorial, but instead I implemented a highscore list which is automatically created(as a .json file) when a highscore is stored.
As in real life the player has to cash out in order to save his/her money _and the highscore_.
I made this rule to add further complexity to the highscore list. This way there is an incentive to not always bet all your money on each game of Blackjack.
