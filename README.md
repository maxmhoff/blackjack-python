# Blackjack (Python)
This was created as an exam project for the Python2 course at KEA.

## A brief disclaimer
I chose not to make the dealer playable even though it was a requirement. This was due to the nature of Blackjack.
The dealer always has to hit unless he/she has a handsum which is equal to or above 17.
I doubt this would be fun for anyone. I suppose I could have made it a tutorial and the AI would have been lovely to make, but instead I implemented a highscore list which is automatically created(as a .json file) when a highscore is stored. I am fairly sure that this increase the lifetime of the game substantially!

## Installation
As long as you're able to run Python from your cmd this should be fairly straight forward. You simply close this repo and run the blackjack.py file.

Once the game is running I recommend that you use the help menu, there are a lot of useful tips.
