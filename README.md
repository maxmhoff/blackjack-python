# Blackjack (Python)
This was created as an exam project for the Python2 course at KEA.

## Some brief thoughts
I chose not to make the dealer playable even though it was a requirement. This was due to the nature of Blackjack.
The dealer always has to hit unless he/she has a handsum which is equal to or above 17.
I doubt this would be fun for anyone. I suppose I could have made it a tutorial and the AI would have been fun to make, but instead I implemented a highscore list which is automatically created(as a .json file) when a highscore is stored.
